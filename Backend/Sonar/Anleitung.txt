To analyze the source code of your project(s), you need to execute the SonarQube Runner.
For the SonarQube Runner to work, the SonarQube Server needs to be running first.

Alternative A:	Execute RunSonarScan.bat  to scan the code of the project and store the results in the database of the SonarQube Server. You can then view the issue-report in the web-frontend of the SonarQube Server at http://localhost:9000/
Alternative B:	Execute RunSonarScanWithHTMLReport.bat which scans the code as with Alternative A, but additionally also stores the issue-report in a static HTML-file at %project_directory%\.sonar\issues-report\issues-report.html
